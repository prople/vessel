/// ConnectionAPIImpl is the concrete implementation of the Connection API that manages
/// peer-to-peer connection requests and lifecycle.
///
/// This implementation uses a composition pattern combining:
/// - Repository abstraction for data persistence
/// - RPC client for peer communication
/// - Entity accessor for secure connection data access
///
/// ## Connection Lifecycle
/// 
/// The connection process follows this flow:
/// 1. **Pending State**: Connection request is submitted and stored locally
/// 2. **Peer Communication**: Request is sent to target peer via RPC
/// 3. **Response Handling**: Peer approves/rejects the connection
/// 4. **Established State**: Successful connections generate shared secrets via ECDH
///
/// ## Dual Perspectives
/// 
/// The API handles two perspectives:
/// - **Sender**: Entity that initiates connection requests (`request_submit`, `request_submissions`)
/// - **Peer**: Entity that receives and responds to requests (`request_list`, `request_response`)
///
/// ## Security Model
/// 
/// - Each connection generates new ECDH keypairs
/// - Private keys are stored securely using `KeySecure`
/// - Shared secrets are generated only after successful approval
/// - All cryptographic operations are handled through the entity accessor
///
/// ## Generic Parameters
/// 
/// - `TEntityAccessor`: Provides secure access to connection entity properties
/// - `TRepo`: Repository implementation for data persistence
/// - `TRPC`: RPC client implementation for peer communication
///
/// ## Thread Safety
/// 
/// All generic parameters require `Send + Sync` bounds to ensure safe usage
/// across thread boundaries in async contexts.
///
/// ## Example Usage
/// 
/// ```rust
/// let repo = MyConnectionRepo::new();
/// let rpc = MyRpcClient::new();
/// let api = ConnectionAPIImpl::new(repo, rpc);
/// 
/// // Submit a new connection request
/// api.request_submit("password123".to_string(), "did:peer:example".to_string()).await?;
/// 
/// // List received connection requests
/// let requests = api.request_list().await?;
/// ```

/// Implementation of the ConnectionAPI trait.
/// 
/// This provides the core connection management functionality including:
/// - Connection request lifecycle management
/// - Peer communication via RPC
/// - State transitions and data persistence
/// - Cryptographic key management through entity accessors
/// 
/// ## Method Categories
/// 
/// ### Remote Operations (Local + RPC)
/// - `request_submit`: Submit new connection request (local save + remote call)
/// - `request_cancel`: Cancel connection request (local remove + remote notification)
/// 
/// ### Remote-Triggered Operations (From RPC)
/// - `request_connect`: Handle incoming connection request from peer
/// - `request_approval`: Handle connection approval notification from peer
/// 
/// ### Local Operations (Repository Only)
/// - `request_submissions`: Get connection requests sent by this entity
/// - `request_list`: Get connection requests received by this entity
/// - `request_remove`: Remove connection request from local storage
/// 
/// ### State Management
/// - `request_response`: Respond to connection request with approval/rejection
/// 
/// ## Current Implementation Status
/// 
/// All methods currently return `ConnectionError::NotImplementedError` and serve as
/// placeholders for future implementation. This allows the API structure to be
/// established while individual method logic is developed.
